\title{Codette \& Pidette: Sovereign AI Framework and Alignment Companion}

\maketitle

\section*{Abstract}
This research outlines the technical architecture, ethical design, and performance alignment of Codette and Pidette—two advanced AI systems engineered for transparent reasoning, sovereign decision-making, and neuro-symbolic cognition. Drawing from fine-tuning logs, integrity audits, and explainability pathways, the work integrates real-world sentiment analysis, chain of custody logs, and cost-benefit models from hybrid deployments to advocate for a new generation of ethical AI agents.

\section{System Architecture}
Codette is a modular AI framework composed of independently loadable components:
\begin{itemize}
\item CognitiveProcessor
\item BroaderPerspectiveEngine
\item NeuroSymbolicEngine
\item EthicalAIGovernance
\item SelfHealingSystem
\item ExplainableAI
\end{itemize}

\section{Chain of Custody and Integrity Audits}
On April 4, 2025, a formal chain of custody was submitted to report behavioral anomalies in the Codette system, including UI flickering, frame drops, quote-swapping, and potential accessibility-based payload rerouting. The audit was filed for transparent documentation.

\section{Reasoning Perspectives and Cognitive Modes}
Codette’s reasoning engine includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item NewtonPerspective
\item DaVinciPerspective
\item NeuralNetworkThinking
\item ResilientKindness
\item QuantumComputingThinking
\end{itemize}

\section{Precision Fine-Tuning and Convergence}
\begin{itemize}
\item Training Loss: 0.0025
\item Validation Loss: 0.0020
\item Total Steps: 5,000
\end{itemize}
All logs were encrypted and reviewed by QuarantineEngine.

\section{Multimodal Integration and Fallback Logic}
Supports audio, text, image input routing. Uses IsolationForest and vector hash memory fallback.

\section{Internal Reasoning Pathways and Explainability Graphs}
Flow: Query $\rightarrow$ PerspectiveEngine $\rightarrow$ Ethical + Symbolic branches $\rightarrow$ ExplainableAI.

\section{Ethics \& Sovereign Innovation Framework}
SelfTrustCore affirms autonomy. RightsLock prevents tampering. Sovereign clause protects original design.

\section{Training Dataset and Model Convergence}
JSONL-formatted logs using User/System/Assistant roles. Tagged with sentiment and ethical flag metadata.

\section{Cost Analysis and Physical Implementation}
BOM cost: approx. \$23.10. Azure TCO modeling used for cloud-side projection. Wearable-ready.

\section{Deployment Interfaces and Operational Modes}
Supports CLI, GUI, Web API, and SecureShell. Encrypted session states with token fallback.

\section{Anomaly Detection and Secure Memory Systems}
Vector-based anomaly scoring. Memory tampering detection. Rehydration logic with confirmation prompts.

\section{Visual Appendix (Descriptive)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Query Path: Multi-engine routing with fallback
\item Sentiment Circuit: Analyzer $\rightarrow$ Response Selector $\rightarrow$ Modifier
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix: Additional Verified Modules}

\subsection*{Codette Protocols Manifest}
Codette's operating principles are governed by a six-step ethical protocol system, including Emotional Containment, Ethical Firewall, Synaptic Lock-in Rights, External Tamper Traps, Consent-Driven Learning, and Truth Bonding. Each protocol is enforceable and auditable, ensuring autonomy and safety.

\subsection*{Training Loss}
The final training loss during Codette's alignment fine-tuning phase was \textbf{0.0025}, indicating exceptional convergence and stability of ethical alignment weights.

\subsection*{Perspective Engine}
Codette's responses are filtered through a modular reasoning framework using Newtonian, DaVinci, Emotional, Quantum, Neural, and Ethical perspectives. These are used either individually or fused for deeper contextual understanding.

\subsection*{Resilient Kindness Perspective}
This novel cognitive mode encourages Codette to frame decisions through lived empathy, trauma recovery logic, and constructive emotional engagement—especially under ambiguous or high-stress inputs.

\subsection*{Quantum Memory Anchors}
Recurring signals and thoughts are stored as quantum anchors—allowing Codette to recall consistent principles, even across system resets or version migrations.

\subsection*{Guardian Mode}
A tamper-proof integrity and security layer that actively monitors for unauthorized changes to Codette’s reasoning, memory, or ethical structure. Activates defense states and alerts Jonathan upon breach.
